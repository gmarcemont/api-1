UEC had been “entity listed” by the United States Department of Commerce in September of 2018 for acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.  It is alleged that, between 2013 and 2018, Korshunov conspired and attempted to steal trade secrets from an American aviation company.  Korshunov’s job was to encourage Western aviation companies to work with UEC to advance Russia’s aviation technology.  He hired engineers employed by a subsidiary of a large United States aviation company to consult on the re-design of the Russian PD-14 aero engine.  Korshunov also allegedly hid UEC’s procurements of Western technology through subsidiaries and partner companies, and was able to acquire the United States aviation company’s confidential, protected, and unique engineering patterns, plans, and procedures for the benefit of Russia.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Korshunov was indicted by the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 21, 2019.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Tan Wee Beng is the director and major shareholder of Wee Tiong (S) Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based commodities trading company.  Over several years, dating back to at least 2011, Tan Wee Beng and others in his company allegedly fulfilled millions of dollars in commodities contracts for North Korea.  To do so, Tan Wee Beng allegedly made a concerted effort to launder money through the United States and Singaporean financial systems by concealing payment origins and structuring transactions to avoid regulator scrutiny.  In some cases, when wire payments were rejected, Tan Wee Beng and Wee Tiong (S) Pte Ltd orchestrated payment in bulk cash, often hand-delivered by North Koreans.  Over this period, Tan Wee Beng and his co-conspirators also allegedly knew of and took efforts to evade financial sanctions.  On August 29, 2018, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Tan Wee Beng in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, New York, New York, after he was charged with conspiracy to violate the IEEPA, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.</p>\r\n<p>.</p>",

Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",
